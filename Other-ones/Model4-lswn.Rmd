This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
lswn = read.csv('SAD-Model4-7.csv')
#largeVsmall <- largeVsmall[largeVsmall$large.perc > largeVsmall$small.perc, ]

library(plyr)

enough.wide.guards = lswn$enough.guards.wide[1]
enough.narrow.guards =lswn$enough.guards.narrow[1]

aggLvS <- ddply(lswn, c("num.ants","large.perc", "small.perc", "enough.narrow", "enough.wide", "not.enough"), summarise, 
                #reps = length(ln.max),
                ln = mean(ln),
                lw = mean(lw),
                sn = mean(sn),
                sw = mean(sw)
                #ln.max.sd = sd(ln.max),
                #ln.min.sd = sd(ln.min),
                #sn.max.sd = sd(sn.max),
                #sn.min.sd = sd(sn.min)
                )

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(reshape2)
aggLvS.m <- melt(aggLvS, id.vars = c("num.ants","large.perc", "small.perc", "enough.narrow", "enough.wide", "not.enough"))

calculateFitness <- function(dfm){
  dfm$h <- ifelse(dfm$variable == 'ln' | 
                          dfm$variable == 'sn' | 
                          dfm$variable == 'ln' | 
                          dfm$variable == 'sn', ceiling(enough.narrow.guards/2), ceiling(enough.wide.guards/2))
  dfm$v <- ifelse(dfm$variable == 'ln' |
                          dfm$variable == 'ln' |
                          dfm$variable == 'lw' |
                          dfm$variable == 'lw', 60, 20)
  
  dfm$d <- (dfm$h^(-1/5))/(1+exp(-(5/dfm$h)*(dfm$value-dfm$h)))
  dfm$s <- exp(-(20)*(1-dfm$d))
  
  dfm
  
  dfFit <- ddply(dfm, c("large.perc", "not.enough", "small.perc", "enough.narrow", "enough.wide", "num.ants"), summarise, fitness = sum(v*s))
  
  return(dfFit)
  #plot(dfFit$num.ants, dfFit$fitness)
}

LvS <- calculateFitness(aggLvS.m)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
