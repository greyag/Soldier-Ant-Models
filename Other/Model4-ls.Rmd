This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
runs = read.csv('SAD-Model4-6.csv')
enough.guards.narrow = runs$enough.guards.narrow[1]
enough.guards.wide = runs$enough.guards.wide[1]
drop <- c("enough.guards.wide", 'enough.guards.narrow', 'large.narrow', 'large.wide', 'small.narrow', 'small.wide', 'h')
runs <- runs[ ,!(names(runs) %in% drop)]
runs$id = seq.int(nrow(df))

library(plyr)
library(reshape2)

calculate.fitness.by.run  <- function (df) {
  dfm <- melt(df, id.vars = c( "id","num.ants","large.perc", "small.perc", "enough.narrow", "enough.wide", "not.enough"))
  dfm$h <- ifelse(grepl("n", dfm$variable), ceiling(enough.guards.narrow/2), ceiling(enough.guards.wide/2))
  dfm$v <- ifelse(grepl("l", dfm$variable), 60, 20)
  dfm$d <- (dfm$h^(-1/5))/(1+exp(-(5/dfm$h)*(dfm$value-dfm$h)))
  dfm$s <- exp(-(5)*(1-dfm$d))
  dfFit <- ddply(dfm, c("id","num.ants","large.perc", "small.perc", "enough.narrow", "enough.wide", "not.enough"), summarise, fitness = sum(v*s))
  return(dfFit)
}

runsFit <- calculate.fitness.by.run(runs)
runsStats <- ddply(runsFit, c("num.ants","large.perc", "small.perc", "enough.narrow", "enough.wide", "not.enough"), summarise, 
                 fitness = mean(fitness),
                 fitSD = sd(fitness))


```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}



LvS <- runStats



#5 ants
hist(LvS[LvS$num.ants == 5, ]$fitness)
best5 = LvS[LvS$num.ants == 5 & LvS$fitness >90, ]
length(best5$fitness)
hist(best5$large.perc, breaks = c(.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best5$small.perc, breaks = c(.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best5$large.perc - best5$small.perc, breaks = c(-.05,.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best5$not.enough, breaks = c(.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best5$enough.narrow, breaks = c(.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))

#15 ants
hist(LvS[LvS$num.ants == 15, ]$fitness)
best15 = LvS[LvS$num.ants == 15 & LvS$fitness > 159, ]
length(best15$fitness)
hist(best15$large.perc, breaks = c(.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best15$small.perc, breaks = c(.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best15$large.perc - best15$small.perc, breaks = c(-1.05,-.95,-.85,-.75,-.65,-.55,-.45,-.35,-.25,-.15,-.05,.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best15$not.enough, breaks = c(.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best15$enough.narrow, breaks = c(.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))



#25 ants
hist(LvS[LvS$num.ants == 25, ]$fitness)
best25 = LvS[LvS$num.ants == 25 & LvS$fitness > 159, ]
length(best25$fitness)
hist(best25$large.perc, breaks = c(.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best25$small.perc, breaks = c(.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best25$large.perc - best25$small.perc, breaks = c(-1.05,-.95,-.85,-.75,-.65,-.55,-.45,-.35,-.25,-.15,-.05,.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best25$not.enough, breaks = c(.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best25$enough.narrow, breaks = c(.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
hist(best25$not.enough - best25$small.perc, breaks = c(-1.05,-.95,-.85,-.75,-.65,-.55,-.45,-.35,-.25,-.15,-.05,.05, .15, .25, .35, .45,.55,.65,.75,.85,.95,1.05))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
